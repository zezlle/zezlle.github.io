    <p>The album "plastic Beach" by the band "Gorillaz" is a timeless gem of an album. Originally released back in 2010, this album got a lot of flack back then due to the fact that the album had few good songs and lots of mediocre and confusing tracks on the album making the album one of the least popular albums to release from the Gorillaz. But as time passed many people realised that the album had great tracks that took some time and patience to mature. The tracks on Plastic Beach are all experimental tracks that are very strange and would definitely take some getting used to but if you have the patience, the music will popout to you. Overall I would give plastic beach a 5/5, mainly because this album is something that I constantly come back to time and time again and I feel that people that like alternative music will really like the band and this album as well.</p>
