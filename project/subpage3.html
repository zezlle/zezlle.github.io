    <p>The album "Flower Boy" by rapper, Tyler the Creator is his newest album that has made go mainstream nationwide. His previous works included more rap as opposed to this album's main focus on singing.I believe that the fact that he cares about singing much more than rap is what made his album become extremely popular. All of the songs on Flower Boy are filled with such a strong sense of passion for singing that it breathed new life into his music that we have never seen before. Overall I would give this album a 5/5, mainly because This album as a whole has lots of amazing songs and shows the crazy amount of passion that Tyler brings into his music. </p> 
    <h2>5/5</h2>
