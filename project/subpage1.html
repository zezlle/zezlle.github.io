      <p>The new album by Foo fighters "concrete and gold" is the bands most experimental album to date. The ten songs throughout this album all sound so different than anything we have seen before. My personal opinion of this album is that it took a lot of risks for going this exerimental but in the end it worked out beautifully. I would give this album a 4/5, mainly because there were definitely hit or miss songs in this album that did not workout well in the song design process.
