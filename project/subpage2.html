    <p>The new album "Colors" by Beck is the artist's has Beck going back to basic. This album is quite possibly the safest album that Beck has created compared to previous projects such as "morning phase" or "sea change" as an example. All of the songs in "Colors" are mostly much more mainstream and are heavily pop music inspired making most of his songs much more likeable and audibly pleasing for first time listeners of Beck's work. overall I would give this album a 5/5 because The album is much more audibly pleasing and not as rough to listen to compared to his older projects. </p> 
    <h2>5/5</h2>
